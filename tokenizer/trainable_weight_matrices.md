_why complicate self-attention with learned matrices (Wq, Wk, Wv), instead of just using raw dot products between the sequence elements?_

Let‚Äôs break this down step by step, and I‚Äôll check in with you along the way.

### 1. Your simpler idea

If we didn‚Äôt use trainable weight matrices, attention would look like this:

- Each token is just a vector from the embedding space.
- We compute **attention scores** by dot-producting those vectors directly.
- Normalize with softmax to make the scores add up to 1.
- Use those weights to take a weighted sum of the embeddings.

This would give you some context mixing ‚Äî but **only in the raw embedding space**.

### 2. Why transformers add learned projections

The key insight is: the _embedding space_ isn‚Äôt always the right space for comparing tokens.

So we add **learnable projections**:

- Queries (Q = XWq)
- Keys (K = XWk)
- Values (V = XWv)

That gives the model the ability to **learn multiple ‚Äúviews‚Äù of the tokens**:

- Wq lets the model decide _what features of the current token matter for asking questions_.
- Wk decides _what features of other tokens should be looked at as answers_.
- Wv decides _what information is actually carried over once attention says ‚Äúyes, that token matters.‚Äù_

Without Wq/Wk/Wv, attention would always compare tokens in the same ‚Äúliteral‚Äù space ‚Äî and couldn‚Äôt adapt to different tasks (syntax vs. semantics, long-range vs. short-range patterns, etc.).

### 3. Multi-head benefit

When we stack multiple sets of (Wq, Wk, Wv), each head learns a different perspective:

- one head might learn to track subject‚Äìverb agreement,
- another head might learn to connect pronouns to antecedents,
- another might focus on word order or local phrases.

If you didn‚Äôt have learnable matrices, **every head would be identical**, since they‚Äôd all just be dot products in the same space.

### 4. Analogy

Think of embeddings as _photographs of objects_.

- If you only ever compared them in the raw photo space, you‚Äôd only notice obvious similarities (colors, pixel values).
- The Wq/Wk projections are like **different feature detectors**: one might look at shapes, another at textures, another at relative positions.
- That‚Äôs how the model learns rich, flexible notions of ‚Äúrelatedness.‚Äù

üí° Let me pause and ask you: does the motivation behind having _separate learned projections for Q, K, and V_ make sense so far, compared to just working in the raw embedding space? Would you like me to show you a toy example of what happens if you remove them?
